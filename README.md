SourceSet 🚀

Where LinkedIn meets GitHub. The unified professional network for Developers and STEM professionals.

🎯 The Vision

SourceSet bridges the gap between static resumes and code repositories. We are building the missing link: a platform that combines the professional networking context of LinkedIn with the technical depth of GitHub.

Developers shouldn't have to maintain a fragmented presence. SourceSet allows you to build your Source of Truth once—merging your career history with your actual engineering output—and showcase it natively on any device.

🌟 Core Features

True Cross-Platform: A single Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) codebase delivering 100% native apps for iOS, Android, and Web.

Smart Directory: Find talent not just by job title, but by actual code capability and tech stack usage.
